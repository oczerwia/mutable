TODO / Next steps

[*] For next meeting
[x] done
[ ] open


Diese Woche (Mini-Plan: Mo 11 Aug → Fr 15 Aug):

[ ] Monday:
  [ ] Decide CSV schema (query_id, operator_id, estimator_type, est_card, true_card, q_error, stage)
  [ ] Implement CSV writing functions (append mode)
  [ ] Test export with 1–2 queries locally

[ ] Tuesday:
  [ ] Run JOB-light subset (5 queries) with histogram, selectivity, cartesian product estimators
  [ ] Store CSV outputs for all runs
  [ ] Verify q-error calculation correctness

[ ] Wednesday:
  [ ] Debug any CSV or estimator issues
  [ ] Run full JOB-light for histogram + selectivity
  [ ] Store results locally with date-stamped filenames

[ ] Thursday:
  [ ] Write analysis script to compute mean/median q-error per estimator
  [ ] Generate q-error distribution plot (histogram/log-scale)
  [ ] (Optional) Implement intermediate error accumulation metric

[ ] Friday:
  [ ] Generate plots (q-error CDF, boxplot/log-scale per estimator)
  [ ] Summarize observations in short text (baseline results: hist vs sel vs cartesian)
  [ ] Archive code, CSVs, and plots in a dated folder


[ ] Innovation
    [*] How to propagate ranges? UB: Recompute LpBound LB: ???
    [x] How to collapse ranges? - Expected value or upper bound
    [*] How to create lower bound?

[ ] Benchmark
    [x] For JOB light
    [*] Test on larger RAM
    [*] Scrape intermediate and final cardinalities
    [*] Get true cardinalities
    [*] Calculate error margin (q-error)
    [ ] Create new metric for accumulated intermediate error
    [ ] Benchmark wallclock time

[x] Statistics
    [x] Histogram generation
    [x] Selectivity generation
    [x] Histogram calculations
    [x] Selectivity calculations

[ ] estimator
    [x] Selectivity based estimator
    [*] Histogram based estimator and propagation: How and where do we change sizes, also, we need to adjust all histogram total counts based on the join. (table1.x = table2.x reduces size, so table1.y and table2.h must also be smaller)
    [ ] Propagation for Range Based estimator
    [ ] LpBound based estimator - Need to be able to extract subqueries (should be possible as it is an option)

[*] Lp Bound
    [*] Understand code 
    [*] Run code on benchmark
    [*] Adjust cardinality injection code
    [*] Inject Cardinalities into estimation
    [*] Intermediate cardinalities
    [*] Make LpBound runnable from mutables
