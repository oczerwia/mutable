TODO / Next steps

[*] For next meeting
[x] done
[ ] open

[ ] Features
    [ ] Util class for table names - names, columns, joined, etc.
    [ ] Store intermediate cards


[ ] Innovation
    [*] How to propagate ranges? UB: Recompute LpBound LB: ???
    [x] How to collapse ranges? - Expected value or upper bound
    [*] How to create lower bound?

[ ] Benchmark
    [x] For JOB light
    [*] Test on larger RAM
    [*] Scrape intermediate and final cardinalities
    [*] Get true cardinalities
    [*] Calculate error margin (q-error)
    [ ] Create new metric for accumulated intermediate error
    [ ] Benchmark wallclock time

[ ] Statistics
    [x] Histogram generation
    [x] Selectivity generation
    [x] Histogram calculations
    [x] Selectivity calculations

[ ] estimator
    [x] Selectivity based estimator
    [*] Histogram based estimator and propagation: How and where do we change sizes, also, we need to adjust all histogram total counts based on the join. (table1.x = table2.x reduces size, so table1.y and table2.h must also be smaller)
    [ ] Propagation for Range Based estimator

[*] Lp Bound
    [*] Understand code 
    [*] Run code on benchmark
    [*] Adjust cardinality injection code
    [*] Inject Cardinalities into estimation
    [*] Intermediate cardinalities
    [*] Make LpBound runnable from mutables
