TODO / Next steps

[*] For next meeting
[x] done
[ ] open


Must solve:
[ ] Make runnable on server

This evening:
[ ] Try to run all of JOB-light on a single sql file


Issues:
[ ] Statistics in general seem a bit fishy, investigate with Python to compare

small feature:
[ ] Add a function that gives the option to flush the complete card storage -> Removes the need for ingesting the data all the time
[ ] Make histogram bin size a system parameter
[ ] Implement sampling for statistics

Refactoring:
  [ ] Understand and clean complete cardinalityStorage
  [ ] Move cardstorage into a cpp file
  [ ] Move cardinality storage retrieval (for join) into estimator
  [ ] Split up functions in CardinalityStorage
    [ ] Matching based on operators first
  [ ] SPN Function uses callbacks and internal query calls to learn the SPN, could use that for LPBound and Tablestatistics


Diese Woche (Mini-Plan: Mo 11 Aug → Fr 15 Aug):


[ ] Tuesday:
  [ ] Verify q-error calculation correctness -> Need to specify what to do when one of both is 0

[ ] Wednesday:
  [ ] Run full JOB-light for histogram + selectivity

[x] Thursday:
  [x] Write analysis script to compute mean/median q-error per estimator
  [x] Generate q-error distribution plot (histogram/log-scale)
  [x] (Optional) Implement intermediate error accumulation metric

[ ] Friday:
  [ ] Generate plots (q-error CDF, boxplot/log-scale per estimator)
  [ ] Summarize observations in short text (baseline results: hist vs sel vs cartesian)
  [ ] Archive code, CSVs, and plots in a dated folder


[ ] Innovation
    [*] How to propagate ranges? UB: Recompute LpBound LB: ???
    [*] How to create lower bound?

[ ] Benchmark
    [*] Benchmark wallclock time
    [ ] Run complete JOB-light
    [*] Test on larger RAM

[ ] estimator
    [ ] Propagation for Range Based estimator
    [ ] LpBound based estimator - Need to be able to extract subqueries (should be possible as it is an option)

[*] Lp Bound
    [*] Understand code 
    [*] Run code on benchmark
    [*] Adjust cardinality injection code
    [*] Inject Cardinalities into estimation
    [*] Intermediate cardinalities
    [*] Make LpBound runnable from mutables

###############
CODE ASSUMPTIONS
###############

- Selectivity
  - Lots of stuff
- Histograms
  - Even more stuff

###############
CODE Short cuts
###############

- removed some of the job-light lines that were faulty (mostly because of insertion of ',' in the notes section)
