TODO / Next steps

[*] For next meeting
[x] done
[ ] open


Today:
[ ] Move card est for join to estimator
[ ] Fix / activate range based
[ ] Test DPsizeOpt
[ ] Run complete benchmark on limited rows

[ ] Map out all leetcode topics
[ ] Start going over DBT slides and add anki cards

Optional:
[ ] Implement histogram based worse case / intersection style 

Tomorrow:
[ ] Write Sebastian the server mail
[ ] Make collapse function shell selectable
[ ] Start collecting papers on card est
[ ] Check wall clock timer
[ ] Fully finish data analysis pipeline / generate automated reporting
[ ] Read papers
  [ ] Determine q-error calculation
  [ ] Map out / document approaches with Zotero

[ ] Think about how to propagate the range

Wednesday:
[ ] Have one range based estimation completely run and analyzed
[ ] 



Must solve:
[ ] Make runnable on server -> Server still seems to not work POSTPONED
  [ ] Run full job-light
[ ] Write full analysis script that just takes in the stats

Naive Range Estimators
[ ] Rule based propagation
[ ] Histogram based propagation


Issues:
[ ] Statistics in general seem a bit fishy, investigate with Python to compare

small feature:
[ ] Make histogram bin size a system parameter
[ ] Implement sampling for statistics

Refactoring:
  [ ] Understand and clean complete cardinalityStorage
  [ ] Move cardstorage into a cpp file
  [ ] Move cardinality storage retrieval (for join) into estimator
  [ ] Split up functions in CardinalityStorage
    [ ] Matching based on operators first


[ ] Tuesday:
  [ ] Verify q-error calculation correctness -> Need to specify what to do when one of both is 0

[ ] Wednesday:
  [ ] Run full JOB-light for histogram + selectivity

[ ] Innovation
    [*] How to propagate ranges? UB: LB: ???
    [*] How to create lower bound?

[ ] Benchmark
    [*] Benchmark wallclock time
    [*] Run complete JOB-light
    [*] Test on larger RAM

[ ] estimator
    [ ] Propagation for Range Based estimator
    [ ] LpBound based estimator - Need to be able to extract subqueries (should be possible as it is an option)

###############
CODE ASSUMPTIONS
###############

- Selectivity
  - Lots of stuff
- Histograms
  - Even more stuff

###############
CODE Short cuts
###############

- removed some of the job-light lines that were faulty (mostly because of insertion of ',' in the notes section)
