[*] For next meeting
[x] done

[ ] Innovation
    [*] How to propagate ranges? UB: Recompute LpBound LB: ???
    [x] How to collapse ranges? - Expected value or upper bound
    [*] How to create lower bound?
    [ ] What has this to do with cords?

[ ] Benchmark
    [x] For JOB light
    [ ] Test on larger RAM
    [ ] Scrape intermediate and final cardinalities
    [ ] Get true cardinalities
    [ ] Calculate error margin (q-error)
    [ ] Create new metric for accumulated intermediate error
    [ ] Benchmark wallclock time

[ ] Statistics
    [x] Histogram generation
    [x] Selectivity generation
    [*] Histogram calculations
    [ ] Selectivity calculations
    [ ] Use correlation (functional dependency) metric to aid 1D histograms?

[ ] estimator
    [*] Histogram based estimator and propagation: How and where do we change sizes, also, we need to adjust all histogram total counts based on the join. (table1.x = table2.x reduces size, so table1.y and table2.h must also be smaller)
    [ ] Propagation for Range Based estimator

[ ] Lp Bound
    [ ] Understand code 
    [ ] Run code on benchmark
    [ ] Adjust cardinality injection code
    [ ] Inject Cardinalities into estimation
    [ ] Intermediate cardinalities?
