TODO / Next steps

[*] For next meeting
[x] done
[ ] open

Debug:
  - size (in datamodel) is completely weird
  - If we set the cardinality, the model state is not adjusted -> I.e. histograms stay the same but the cardinality has changed
  - Look if stored source tables need to be reset on the cardinality storage


Today:
[x] Move card est for join to estimator // Will not do this, as each enumerator has its own way of adressing
[x] Test DPsizeOpt
[x] Fix / activate range based

[x] Store ranges as well
[x] Make collapse function shell selectable

[x] Map out all leetcode topics
[x] Start going over DBT slides and add anki cards (first 3 chapters)

Tomorrow:
[ ] Write Sebastian the server mail
[ ] Check wall clock timer and add to csv
[ ] Run complete benchmark on limited rows
[ ] Start collecting papers on card est

[ ] Read papers
  [ ] Determine q-error calculation
  [ ] Map out / document approaches with Zotero
[ ] Fully finish data analysis pipeline / generate automated reporting
[ ] Continue with anki cards -> From chapter 4 onwards

[ ] Think about how to propagate the range

Wednesday:
[ ] Have one range based estimation completely run and analyzed


Side:
[ ] Understand Gospers Hack / DpSizeOpt



Must solve:
[ ] Make runnable on server -> Server still seems to not work POSTPONED
  [ ] Run full job-light
[ ] Write full analysis script that just takes in the stats

Naive Range Estimators
[ ] Rule based propagation
[ ] Histogram based propagation


Issues:
[ ] Statistics in general seem a bit fishy, investigate with Python to compare

small feature:
[ ] Make histogram bin size a system parameter
[ ] Implement sampling for statistics

Refactoring:
  [ ] Understand and clean complete cardinalityStorage
  [ ] Move cardstorage into a cpp file
  [ ] Move cardinality storage retrieval (for join) into estimator
  [ ] Split up functions in CardinalityStorage
    [ ] Matching based on operators first


[ ] Tuesday:
  [ ] Verify q-error calculation correctness -> Need to specify what to do when one of both is 0

[ ] Wednesday:
  [ ] Run full JOB-light for histogram + selectivity

[ ] Innovation
    [*] How to propagate ranges? UB: LB: ???
    [*] How to create lower bound?

[ ] Benchmark
    [*] Benchmark wallclock time
    [*] Run complete JOB-light
    [*] Test on larger RAM

[ ] estimator
    [ ] Propagation for Range Based estimator
    [ ] LpBound based estimator - Need to be able to extract subqueries (should be possible as it is an option)

###############
CODE ASSUMPTIONS
###############

- Selectivity
  - Lots of stuff
- Histograms
  - Even more stuff

###############
CODE Short cuts
###############

- removed some of the job-light lines that were faulty (mostly because of insertion of ',' in the notes section)
